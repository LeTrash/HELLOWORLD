# Overview


Provide a simple board for people from BYU-I to discuss controversial topics about the campus and university, in hopes that they will be given a voice to reach those with the power to do something about it.

# Web Pages

I created a simple web page that displays a question box to start the discussion with a reply button in the corner. I made it as a container so that other questions could be added without copying and pasting code.

# Development Environment

I used React to implement this project as well as Visual Studio Code for the IDE. I then used Firebase and its libraries to create a database for the comments to reside and be saved.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add in more questions and make the design look nice/full.
* Connect the database to the react code so that it works properly.
* Add a main page that lists several different topics to discuss.
