# Overview

I created a drawing web app utilizing typescript. I utilized typescript in order to change colors and stroke width once users pressed certain buttons. I also allowed the user to download the image they created to their browser in case they've made a masterpiece they want to share.

# Future Work

- Fix stop and start of strokes for different dimensions and colors
- Have a pop-up for the downloads so they can name the file and save it in a certain place on their computer
- Add in a color picker
- Add in a slider bar for the stroke
