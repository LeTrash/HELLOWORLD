# Overview

I created a drawing web app utilizing typescript. I utilized typescript in order to change colors and stroke width once users pressed certain buttons. I also allowed the user to download the image they created to their browser in case they've made a masterpiece they want to share.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
